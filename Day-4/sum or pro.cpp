/*

You are given a number ‘N’ and a query ‘Q.’ 
If ‘Q’ is 1, then you have to return the sum of all integers from 1 to ‘N,’ 
else if ‘Q’ is equal to 2 then you have to return the product of all integers from 1 to ‘N.’ 
Since the product can be very large, return it modulo 10 ^ 9 + 7.

For example

Given ‘N’ = 4, ‘Q’ = 1. 
Then the answer is 10 because the sum of all integers between 1 and 4 are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
Hence 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 is equal to 10.

Sample Input 1 :
2
4 1 
4 2
Sample Output 1 :
10
24
